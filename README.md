# COVID Blows!

## Getting Startled

### Install Dependencies

Running `npm install` will install package dependencies, build the JS bundle, and load the latest datasets.

```sh
$ npm install
```

### Start the Server

Start it by running

```sh
$ npm start
```

Now just visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 in a browser window to watch the magic happen!

## Developing

For developing, start watching source files for changes on-the-fly.

```sh

# watch and re-build JS bundle if necessary

$ npm start build watch
```
